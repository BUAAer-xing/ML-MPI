The performance of the journal in 2006 is reviewed. Editorial transitions, including the appointment of new senior and associate editors are described. Finally, proposals for a new special issue are invited. These proposals should focus on and highlight emerging, interdisciplinary research on novel and underresearched phenomena and must adhere to the guidelines developed for the journal.
