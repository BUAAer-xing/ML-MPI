In this paper we focus empirical and conceptual attention on the social construction of information systems (IS) requirements, and illustrate that IS developers too often choose to ignore, and thus effectively black-box, the complexities of gathering requirements in order to simplify both the difficulties of their work and their relations with customers. The empirical contribution of this paper is evidence drawn from a study of how IS developers pursue requirements engineering and how they conceive its value. The factors we found to be important in this process include: the changing needs of the organization, the ways in which structured IS methods are enacted via experience and social competency, the formation of project groups, and finally engagement in interpersonal conflict and negotiations. Our conceptual contribution is theorization on the nature of developing requirements as a process of social learning. .
