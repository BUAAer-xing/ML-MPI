The academic popularity of the topic of electronic cross-organizational and cross-border collaboration is perhaps best evident in the large number of publications on this topic. For example, a systematic review of 1180 papers published between 2000 and 2007 in only six information systems (IS) journals reveals that 80 papers are related to electronic cross-organizational and cross-border collaboration. This EJIS special issue attracted a record number of 66 paper submissions of which eight were finally accepted for publication. In the context of this special issue, we define the focus of interest as 'the integration of people, systems, processes and infrastructure across organizations, borders, nations and world regions to enable productive teamwork towards accomplishing mutual goals'. .
