This paper puts forward a case for using hermeneutics in information systems ( IS) research. Unlike case study and action research, which could now be described as 'mainstream' interpretive research in IS, hermeneutics is neither well accepted nor much practiced in IS research. A suitable hermeneutic approach is described in detail. A brief account of hermeneutics in action is provided through a description of research investigating notions of convenience in home Internet shopping. The hermeneutic circle enabled the researcher to reveal unexpectedly the practice of using surrogates in Internet shopping and this example illustrates some of the potential of the approach in IS research.
