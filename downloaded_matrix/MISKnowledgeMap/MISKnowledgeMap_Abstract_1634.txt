This paper develops the utilization-based information technology (IT) success model by integrating key variables from IT acceptance and IT success literatures, and empirically validates it. The model shows relations among IT utilization, performance expectancy, social influence, and user satisfaction. A field study was undertaken to evaluate and test the relationships via structural equation modeling using LISREL. The path from performance expectancy and user satisfaction to IT utilization was positive and significant. While the path from implicit social influence to IT utilization was found to be significant, explicit social influence had no significant influence on users' IT utilization. Implications and future research directions are drawn.
