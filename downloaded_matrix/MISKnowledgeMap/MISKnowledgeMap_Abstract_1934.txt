Information systems (IS) research has drawn heavily on social and cognitive psychology to explain technology adoption. Indeed, the many variations of the technology acceptance model all share these same theoretical foundations. Focusing exclusively on the socio-cognitive lens can lead to overlooking enhanced explanations of technology acceptance, such that new theoretical perspectives may be warranted. In this qualitative grounded theory study, we discovered how the lens of evolutionary psychology, as embodied in the Four-Drive model, was helpful in understanding technology acceptance across three organizational sites. We contend that evolutionary psychology is an important addition to the theoretical repertoire of IS researchers, and propose including 'evolved psychological mechanisms' within traditional models of technology acceptance. .
