Integrated information systems and operational efficiency are both pivotal issues for contemporary firms. While there is substantial evidence that enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems can deliver related improvements, the implementation of these systems can turn out to be a very complex and risky task. One key aspect of managing these risks is maintaining operational momentum and preventing possible problems from escalating in the so-called shakedown phase shortly after system implementation. The objective of this paper is to examine how user evaluations of ERP system success could be used to trace down the source of potential problems, which can arise during the shakedown phase, and how and why experienced system success might vary between different user groups. The paper builds on a case study completed in the after-sales division of a large multinational organization. This context is considered a fruitful empirical setting for the study as the business sets enormous demands for ERP system functionality and its smooth implementation. Based on the case study, it is argued that in such a context the importance of sufficient user skills, data reliability and intra-organizational communication becomes emphasized in the ERP implementation process. Moreover, results illustrate how downstream operations and customer relations are particularly vulnerable to problems accumulated in upstream business processes. Related problems can potentially form a self-fulfilling cycle, where the lack of skills and information constantly deteriorates both user perceptions and actual operational performance.
