As information and communication technologies began to support new forms of interaction between governments and their constituents, the concept of e-government emerged as a new domain for Information Systems (IS) researchers. The past decade has seen a variety of e-government themes researched and presented by scholars in IS, public administration, and political science. In order to reflect on the history of the IS discipline, this article provides an historical assessment of electronic government research. In particular, we review highly cited e-government articles and e-government articles published in the AIS Senior Scholars' basket of journals to assess existing publication outlets, theoretical foundations, methodological approaches, sampling, and topic areas. The analysis of the literature reveals significant insights about the metamorphosis of e-government research over time, the assessment of which serves as a basis for recommendations for future research on this global phenomenon.
