Shared mental models (SMMs) provide an approach to improving team learning and performance. SMM means that team members share common expectations about the team processes, results, !and individual roles in achieving the team's objective. Our model of antecedents and consequences of SMMs demonstrates how cognitive capabilities contribute to effective software development teams. Higher scores on two meta-level cognitive skills (A-shaped skills and T-shaped skills) and a personality characteristic (agreeableness), which help teammates coordinate their skills and knowledge, enhance the development of an SMM and thereby enhance team performance. The results open new and important areas for research into both the meta-level cognitive skills and the agreeable characteristic required for team effectiveness. There is also promise for new approaches to team building.
