We investigate the dynamics of blog reading behavior of employees in an enterprise blogosphere. A dynamic model is developed and calibrated using longitudinal data from a Fortune 1,000 IT services firm. Our modeling framework allows us to segregate the impact of textual characteristics (sentiment and quality) of a post on attracting readers from retaining them. We find that the textual characteristics that appeal to the sentiment of the reader affect both reader attraction and retention. However, textual characteristics that reflect only the quality of the posts affect only reader retention. We identify a variety-seeking behavior of blog readers where they dynamically switch from reading on one set of topics to another. The modeling framework and findings of this study highlight opportunities for the firm to influence blog-reading behavior of its employees to align it with its goals. Overall, this study contributes to improved understanding of reading behavior of individuals in communities formed around user generated content.
