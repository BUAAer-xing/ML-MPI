The technology acceptance model ( TAM) is one of the most widely used behavioural models in the information systems ( IS) field. Researchers have used the model to study many different IS adoption situations and contexts, and it usually demonstrates validity and reliability. Although TAM was developed in the U. S., the TAM model has also been used in other countries. Transferring a model to another cultural context should be subjected to rigorous testing, and a few studies have begun to examine the applicability of TAM in a small variety of cultures. This study contributes to the growing multi- cultural examination of TAM, and demonstrates that although the model has been successful in predicting adoption behaviours in some international settings, it might not hold in all cultures. Almost 4000 students from several universities around the world provided the data for the study. Data analysis revealed that the TAM model does not hold for certain cultural orientations. Most significantly, low Uncertainty Avoidance, high Masculinity, high- Power Distance, and high Collectivism seem to nullify the effects of Perceived Ease of Use and/ or Perceived Usefulness. Since TAM has been shown to be widely applicable to various technological innovations, it is likely to continue to be applied broadly and globally. However, the results of this study suggest the need for caution in applying TAM in at least 20 countries.
