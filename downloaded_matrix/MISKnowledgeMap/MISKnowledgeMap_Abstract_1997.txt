This paper analyses how human-knowledge resources affect interorganisational systems (IOS) capabilities and subsequently attainment of operational and strategic benefits. A conceptual model is constructed combining the transaction cost economics (TCE) view, resource-based view (RBV) and insights from IOS literature. The model is tested through a triangulation approach combining two qualitative case studies and a quantitative field study within the logistics sector. This sector is chosen due to its need for high reliance on information technology. The findings indicate that human knowledge positively influences IOS capabilities related to cross-organisational business processes and transfer of knowledge. Findings also show that strategic benefits are the consequence of knowledge transfer, when the transfer supports business processes resulting in operational benefits. The main theoretical contribution of this paper is that it combines a TCE view and RBV to analyse the effect of relationship-specificity of human-based knowledge resources in IOS.
