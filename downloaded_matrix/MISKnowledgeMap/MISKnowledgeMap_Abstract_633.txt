Drawing upon the requirements and software development literature, the present study proposes an integrative contingency model for requirements development. Based on 116 quality journal articles, we analyze requirements development risks, requirements development techniques, and heuristics for how they are effectively related. Subsequently, we synthesize the insights from the identified literature into a model for requirements development that relates patterns of risk resolution to archetypical risk profiles. The model integrates the literature on requirements and software development; sets the scene for future research; and, finally, proposes how practitioners can manage risks in requirements development projects.
