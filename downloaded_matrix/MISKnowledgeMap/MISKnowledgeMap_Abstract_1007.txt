This commentary paper aims to highlight issues associated with the supposed ability to transfer knowledge across networks. In response to the paper "Risks in Organizational Networks: An Exploratory Framework", (Trkman and Desouza, this issue, pp. XXX-XXX), we argue that the taken-for-granted assumption that knowledge is transferrable represents a risk in itself. We analyze knowledge in networks using a practice perspective - in turn we consider knowledge as enacted in social practices and as context-specific. In contrast with Trkman and Desouza's paper, we argue that if knowledge is seen as enacted in practice, a framework that maps risks associated with knowledge transfer is limiting. We conclude that, since knowing in practice is emergent and not fully controllable, adopting a set of best practices on how to effectively transfer (or not) knowledge could itself be risky for managers who then believe that knowledge can be treated as a commodity and easily moved about a network.
