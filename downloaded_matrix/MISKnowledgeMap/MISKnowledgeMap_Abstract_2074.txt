We discuss the challenges of implementing an Internet-based platform for creating collaborative supply chains using a case study in the retail sector. The case presents how an Internet-based collaboration platform was implemented to address the strategic issue of increasing shelf availability and customer service in grocery retailing, an issue that has emerged as one of the major confrontations for the whole sector over the past years. The case presented shows the challenges of executing such strategic collaborative supply-chain initiatives which, although arguably beneficial, can be hindered by IT adoption failures. A longitudinal view of the case is presented, from an initial pilot back in 2001 to the final success in 2005. We discuss the particular challenges of the execution of Internet-enabled collaborative supply-chain initiatives as well as possible managerial actions through a simple framework we develop based on the lessons from the case.
