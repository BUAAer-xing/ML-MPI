In this paper. I seek to intertwine the IS research on globalization with IS research on culture. I first discuss various perspectives of globalization - cultural imperialism, interconnected businesses, and a global village - and the accompanying role of information technologies. I then present a brief overview of three waves of IS culture research: identifying differences, explaining differences, managing differences. Based upon the gaps identified in the overview. I suggest some propositions for future IS culture research. Finally, I seek to identify important future research that lies at the intersection of globalization and culture research, namely research into global knowledge transparency. Global knowledge transparency involves the dual objectives of providing more detailed product and service information to the consumer and gathering more detailed knowledge about the individual. The former helps individuals make more responsible choices in their purchase decisions, enabling them to understand the consequences of their choices on the well-being of others. The latter helps individuals make more informed decisions concerning their own well-being, enabling them to better understand the consequences of their choices for their own life and health. Taken together, the two objectives of global knowledge transparency can help societies promote better use of resources and more individual accountability.
