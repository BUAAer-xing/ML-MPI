The growth in the application of information technology to student and employee learning underscores the need to understand the impact of technology-mediated learning (TML) methods. Using previous developed TML models, based on social cognitive theory and adaptive structuration meta-theory, the effectiveness of three training methods were examined in this study: technology mediated (using both vicarious and enactive learning), and collaborative and combined (collaborative plus technology mediated). The study also focused on the learning process. The experimental study results showed a significant positive influence of enactive learning enabled TML and collaborative training on specific training outcomes, and the combined training method shows positive results on all training outcomes. The study results also showed that faithful appropriation of the training methods during the learning process has a moderator effect on training outcomes. The study provides important research implications for theory and practice.
