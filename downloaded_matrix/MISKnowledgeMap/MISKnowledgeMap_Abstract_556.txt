Social networks constructed on digital platforms are becoming increasingly pervasive in all aspects of individual and organizational life. This special issue of Information Systems Research includes 10 papers that focus on the interplay between digital and social networks. The interplay draws attention to the fact that digital interaction among individuals and organizations is almost always embedded in, influenced by, and in turn influences a social network. The papers in this special issue collectively shed light on the technical, behavioral, and economic challenges and implications of such networks and contribute to our understanding of how the power of such networks can be harnessed.
