The rapid spread of technological innovations like mobile data services ( MDS) has made mobile computing a fact of everyday life for many people. Therefore, we need to understand the contribution of mobile computing to overall quality of life ( QoL). Employing the satisfaction hierarchy model and bottom- up spillover theory, this study proposes a theoretical model in the context of MDS that connects user satisfaction ( a traditional outcome variable of IT) with contribution to QoL ( a new outcome variable for mobile computing) in a range of life domains. The validity of the proposed model and outcome variable was tested through three empirical studies conducted in Korea. User satisfaction with MDS was found to affect the contribution of MDS to QoL in eleven life domains, and these contributions in turn influenced the overall contribution of MDS to QoL. The paper ends with a discussion of the study's implications and limitations.
