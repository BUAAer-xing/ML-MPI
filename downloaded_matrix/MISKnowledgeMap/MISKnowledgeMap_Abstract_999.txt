This paper investigates the role of insurer and broker expectations in achieving long-term benefit success from electronic trading in the insurance industry. The paper highlights the importance of intra- and inter-organisational expectations with the implementation of electronic data intercharge, as a major electronic trading initiative within the insurance industry. A benefits management model is conceptualised to explore the effects of competitive stimuli and depict the technology management response of insurers and brokers within the case study. The model highlights the importance of managing benefits and expectations in developing long-term partnerships for the successful implementation of electronic trading. The technology management response among key stakeholders and the roles of communication, coordination and support during the implementation phase are also discussed. Finally, a number of lessons are recommended, which should be of use to practitioners and concluding remarks indicate areas for future research.
