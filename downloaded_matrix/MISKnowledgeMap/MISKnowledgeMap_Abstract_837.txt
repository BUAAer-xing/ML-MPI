Enterprise information systems are usually mandatory. However, surprisingly little research has been directed to the nature and operation of mandates in research on enterprise systems and on information technology implementation. This study takes a closer look at mandates and their role in the implementation and acceptance of enterprise technologies. Our analysis focuses on the implementation of two enterprise level systems in a major state-funded university system in the US: (1) a state-wide financial management information system that is mandated for use by a large university system; and (2) a system-wide financial and administrative information system that is designed at the university system level and mandated for the individual units of the university system. The analysis offers a deeper look at mandates and is intended to surface features not evident when mandates are regarded simply as another type of directive or order from top management. It also illuminates the politics of enterprise system implementation from the perspective of the negotiation of meaning and responsibilities.
