This study explores how and why information systems development (ISD) approaches differ in their tactics to control the behaviour of development teams. Drawing from prior research on organisational control, we conduct qualitative case studies at four organisations to examine the extent that traditional and contemporary systems development approaches can highlight a unique combination of control attributes. Based on the data collected, we build an ISD control typology that differentiates ISD approaches on the basis of control objectives (product or process focused) and control practices (preventive or detective/corrective focused). The proposed typology can be used by practitioners to inform and guide more effective systems development control choices while providing researchers with a new model that recognises the unique control aspects of today's systems development approaches.
