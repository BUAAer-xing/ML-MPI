We propose an analytical model that evaluates the information completeness of object tracking systems based on their size, breadth and reading depth. We showcase that the larger size of a system's configuration does not ensure better completeness; instead, the effect of reading depth is greater. The completeness of tracking information can characterize the visibility of the inspected objects the tracking systems offer. The model may be used for both ex-ante and ex-post evaluations of the visibility of tracking systems versus their deployment cost, considering that the emergence of real-time tracking and sensing technologies will boost the adoption of such systems.
