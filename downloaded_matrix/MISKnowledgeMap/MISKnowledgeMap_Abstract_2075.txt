Despite the efforts of governments and the various support programmes, achievement of advanced stages of e-commerce by small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is still very low. There have been some attempts to study the dynamic nature of websites, but there is still little research evidence to explain why and how SMEs evolve their web presence. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive classification of drivers for web site redesign based on interviews with various members of staff from SMEs in the U.K. that have recently redesigned their web sites. A sequential mixed-methodological analysis, involving the use of qualitative and quantitative data analysis, was used to develop the classification. This enabled the development of a framework that classified seven main categories of drivers for web site redesign. The drivers identified were: changing business requirements, evolving internet strategies, addressing user needs, maintenance, changing technology, pressure from peers/competitors, and the influence of developers. However, only the first four were found to be significant in the study. The categorisation and the findings suggest a number of key determinants not explicitly addressed by other work. In addition, the findings provide little support for the staged approach to e-commerce progression as few companies reported the implementation of sophisticated internet technology features as a main reason for their web site redesigns. The contributions of this paper are firstly, to provide an instrument to the academic and practitioner communities interested in the topic of web site evolution. Secondly, the categorisation of drivers for redesign and the individual reasons found in this study are expected to provide assistance to SME managers to justify, plan and strategise internet investments realistically and effectively. .
