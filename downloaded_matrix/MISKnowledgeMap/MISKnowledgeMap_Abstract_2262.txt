While software development teams are becoming more and more distributed around the globe, most software development methodologies used by global teams prescribe self-managing teams. Transformational leadership is the key to successful information systems development and use for competitive advantage. Yet, little is known about transformational leadership in self-managing global information systems development team settings. This study answers the research question of how leaders emerge and strategically influence systems development in self-managing global information systems development teams. This question is answered with a grounded theory study of Apache Open Source Software development teams. A theoretical model of action-embedded transformational leadership is developed to demonstrate how leaders emerge and strategically influence systems development efforts through their leadership, which is embedded in their work-related actions.
