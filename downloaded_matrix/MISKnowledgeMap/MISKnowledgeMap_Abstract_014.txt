Electronic government, or e-government, increases the convenience and accessibility of government services and information to citizens. Despite the benefits of e-government-increased government accountability to citizens, greater public access to information and a more efficient, cost-effective government-the success and acceptance of e-government initiatives, such as online voting and licence renewal, are contingent upon citizens' willingness to adopt this innovation. In order to develop 'citizen-centred' e-government services that provide participants with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional 'brick and mortar' transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. This study integrates constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model, Diffusions of Innovation theory and web trust models to form a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of e-government initiatives. The study was conducted by surveying a broad diversity of citizens at a community event. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use, compatibility and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens' intention to use an e-government service. Implications of this study for research and practice are presented.
