As corporations adopt wireless technologies then both privacy and security landscapes change dramatically, causing a reassessment of how the wireless systems can be secured and at the same time ensuring privacy obligations to their customers, staff and shareholders are met. This paper explores the relationship between wireless security and privacy issues, and develops the foundation for metrics with which to develop and examine appropriate policies. The challenge is to get consistent and supportive security and privacy policies. In addition, the adoption of a wireless infrastructure will result in richer sets of information flows, requiring additional resources to achieve the same level of security as in a wired infrastructure. Richer sets of information are also likely to have a negative impact on privacy.
