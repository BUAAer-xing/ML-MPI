In this paper, I discuss the meaning of the term development as something of concern for all individuals, groups, organizations and societies, and I argue that many different global futures are possible depending on how well we succeed in realising our development goals and aspirations. Information and communication technologies are deeply implicated in approaches to development and in making global futures, and I argue the need for IS research which addresses a diversity of development arenas with context-specific studies, broadly critical in their approach, and aimed at making a better world with technology. I draw implications for action on the part of IS researchers in terms of research agenda, teaching activities, publishing, and institution building.
