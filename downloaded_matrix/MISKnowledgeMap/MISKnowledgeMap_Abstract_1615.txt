This paper examines the situation of non-use of mobile data and voice services. The observed behavior is at odds with positivist socio-economic theories and commonsensical understanding of the possibilities brought about by the ubiquitous information and communications technology environment. Using a multi-method and theoretical framework designed to combine positivist and interpretative approaches, we attempt at developing new insights into the inter-related roles of ICT and consumer behavior in real-life situations. The findings challenge the commonsensical rhetoric on the advancement of Information Society and provide insights for the design of useful information and communication services.
