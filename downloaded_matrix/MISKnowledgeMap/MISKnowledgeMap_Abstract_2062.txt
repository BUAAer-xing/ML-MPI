W e study the problem where a decision maker needs to discover a classification rule to classify intelligent, self-interested agents. Agents may engage in strategic behavior to alter their characteristics for a favorable classification. We show how the decision maker can induce a classification rule that anticipates such behavior while still satisfying an important risk minimization principle.
