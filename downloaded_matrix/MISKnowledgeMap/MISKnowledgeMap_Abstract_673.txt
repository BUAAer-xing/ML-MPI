Within the field of information systems development (ISD) most contributions concern formalised development methods and focus either on how they should be or on how they are used. In contrast, this paper explores the relationship between what influences and shapes a unique and local method and how it consequently emerges. Based on a synthesis of prominent IS literature, an analytical framework is developed using three perspectives: (1) the structuralist, (2) the individualist and (3) the interactive process perspective. Each perspective supplies a set of key concepts for conceptual understanding and empirical exploration of method emergence in practice. The analytical framework is applied to a longitudinal case study of method emergence in a web-based ISD project in a case company where the Multiview methodology was adopted. The case study account is supported by the development and use of a graphical mapping technique, called method emergence mapping for representing the complex interplay between structural elements, human action and the emergent method as it unfolded over time. The contribution of this paper to ISD theory is the development of an analytical framework that can be applied as a lens for explaining how a unique and local method emerges in practice. Also lessons for ISD practice are identified: no 'one' is in control of an ISD project, projects should organise around a vision rather than a fixed plan; and methods should be used as guiding frameworks for action rather than prescriptions.
