There is growing interest in the role and contribution of national information infrastructure (NII) to the quality of governance and the socio-economic development of nation states. In this paper, we use publicly available archival data to explore the relationships among NII, governance, and socio-economic development in developing countries. Results substantiate a significant relationship between NII and governance, and NII and socio-economic development. The findings suggest that NII have the capacity to contribute to country development, both directly (via impacts on socio-economic development) and indirectly (via its impacts on governance, which in turn influences socio-economic development).
