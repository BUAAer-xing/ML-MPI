Sharma and Yetton, in 2003, hypothesized and found empirical support for the moderating effect of task interdependence on the relationship between management support and implementation success. In this issue of EJIS. Hwang and Schmidt critique Sharma and Yetton's meta-analysis protocol, arguing that a random-effects model should have been employed, rather than the fixed-effect model they used. Further, Hwang and Schmidt claim that the moderating effect hypothesized by Sharma and Yetton is not supported when a random-effects model is employed. We re-analyze Sharma and Yetton's data by employing a dedicated, commercially available package for conducting random-effects meta-analysis. Our analysis finds no support for Hwang and Schmidt's claim. The random-effects meta-analysis supports Sharma and Yetton's original findings: task interdependence moderates the effect of management support on implementation success. .
