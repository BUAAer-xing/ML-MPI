This paper reports on an investigation of career anchors of women in the information technology (IT) workforce that was directed at enhancing within-gender theorising about career motivations of women in the IT profession. Our theoretical lens, the individual differences theory of gender and IT, enabled us to look more critically at how the effects of interventions are embedded in the range of women's career anchors that takes within-gender variation into account. The analysis demonstrates that organisational interventions must be flexible enough to account for the diversity and variation among women. Further, the analysis shows that it is necessary to move away from one size fits all organisational interventions that often reflect stereotypes about women in the IT workforce.
