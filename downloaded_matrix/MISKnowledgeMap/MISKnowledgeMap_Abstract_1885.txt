This research presents a model of personal information privacy (PIP) that includes not only transactional data gathering, but also interorganisational data sharing. Emerging technologies are used as a lens through which the discussion of PIP management is extended. Research directions are developed for aspects of privacy, privacy-preserving technologies, interorganisational data sharing and policy development.
