Atul Mahajan nicknamed 'AM,' a wealthy Indian, sits on the board of Kisan Group, his family's chemical company (family and company names disguised). Charged with managing the Mahajan family wealth, he has formed a private equity group that helps build mid-market companies. He has also launched a few technology-enabled ventures of his own, including a company that failed in its attempts to sell a service that used encrypted and masked barcodes for document authentication and a successful company that provided administrative and data management support for pharmaceutical clinical trials. Now, apparently with sufficient resources to contemplate another entrepreneurial venture, AM wonders whether to revive the document authentication business, with a turnkey solution or one or more services that would use encrypted RFID tags instead of the older barcode technology. This teaching case was developed based on interviews with Mr. 'Mahajan' and two other employees. The case provides an opportunity for students to investigate technical, strategic and operational uncertainties and challenges associated with building a business around a new technology. For business schools that are attempting to 'globalize' their curriculum, the case offers the benefit of presenting the point of view of a well-connected Indian entrepreneur.
