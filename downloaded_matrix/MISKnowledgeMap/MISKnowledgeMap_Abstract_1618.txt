The public sector is often considered synonym with inefficiency and a lack of motivation to be innovative. This paper seeks to contribute towards the literature surrounding social entrepreneurship in the public sector, through using institutional theory to underpin an e-Innovations model that promotes social entrepreneurship, while recognising how the adoption of innovation within the public sector is fostered. The proposed model seeks to serve as a process that threatens the conservative and risk-averse culture endemic in the public sector.
