This article contributes to the technology acceptance literature by providing an enriched understanding about how team climate for innovation affects end users' IT use. Empirical data collected from 103 physicians shows that team climate significantly affects the use of a computerized physician order entry system through the mediation of performance expectancy and facilitating conditions. Team climate also affects users' subjective norm, yet subjective norm is not found to have a significant impact on IT use. Our findings confirm the importance of users' proximal social network in voluntary settings, demonstrating that team climate influences IT use behaviors by changing users' cognitive perceptions rather than their normative beliefs.
