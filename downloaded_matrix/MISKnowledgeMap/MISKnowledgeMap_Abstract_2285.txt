As information systems development (ISD) organisations face increasing market demands, strategies such as agile development have been used to help address these demands. Now, as information systems (IS) research in agile development is gaining in theoretical rigour, this study explores the use of mindfulness as a theoretical framework to examine ISD agility. At its core, the mindfulness theoretical concept promotes a focus on continuous attention to detail and vigilance to minimise errors and respond effectively to unexpected events. Incorporating a sixteen month ongoing longitudinal case study of an ISD organisation, this research provides an insight into the practice of what we term doing agile and being agile, while also providing a number of theoretical contributions around the value of mindfulness for ISD agility.
