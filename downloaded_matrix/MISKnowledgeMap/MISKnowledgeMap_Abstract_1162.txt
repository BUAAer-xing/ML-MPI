This paper is about the influence of group inter-action processes known as group learning on the implementation of information technologies ( IT). Aiming at a conceptualisation of the role of user interactions in IT implementation, a theoretical framework based on the experiential learning cycle is developed that includes five processes: collective acting, group reflecting, knowledge disseminating, sharing understanding and mutual adjustment. This theoretical framework is illustrated by the findings from three case studies. Analysis of 87 interviews revealed a unique function of group learning in IT implementation. It showed that group learning emerges immediately after a new IT is introduced to the targeted users and that it can take different standpoints ( for or against adoption of the technology); it can also develop during the IT implementation and either progress or take a turn for the worse. The overall conclusion is that group learning is a 'hidden' mechanism that may speed up, slow down or even terminate an IT implementation project; and that therefore it is essential to appreciate its importance during IT projects and to steer it in a constructive direction.
