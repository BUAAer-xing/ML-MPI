From a database perspective, business constraints provide an accurate picture of the real world being modeled and help enforce data integrity. Typically, rules are gathered during requirements analysis and embedded in code during the implementation phase. We propose that the rules be explicitly modeled during conceptual design, and develop a framework for understanding and classifying spatiotemporal set-based (cardinality) constraints and an associated syntax. The constraint semantics are formally specified using first-order logic. Modeling rules in conceptual design ensures they are visible to designers and users and not buried in application code. The rules can then be semiautomatically translated into logical design triggers yielding productivity gains. Following the principles of design science research, we evaluate the framework's expressiveness and utility with a case study.
