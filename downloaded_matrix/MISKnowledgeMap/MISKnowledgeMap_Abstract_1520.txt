This paper looks at Knowledge Management Systems (KMS) from the perspective of critical research. Using the concepts of 'gaze' and 'face', we examine the development and use of a web-based KMS in Taiwan. The findings indicate that, although a web-based KMS was developed to enable knowledge sharing, the capabilities for surveillance inherent in the KMS severely limited sharing. This study raises broader questions about the relationship between cultural values and the production of knowledge in KMS. .
