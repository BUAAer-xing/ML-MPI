Telecentres are seen as essential components of governance reform in the international development community and great optimism has been expressed in academic and policy literature regarding their developmental potential. The scope of our paper is to move beyond the confines of conventional governance ideology and to propose a broader conceptual lens through which to study the complexity of issues that need to be addressed in order to make telecentres sustainable. Following several years of experience with these projects, evidence shows that their long-term survival depends upon how interactions are managed between a host of players including the government, private entrepreneurs, international donors, telecommunications suppliers, local companies, civil society organisations and individual community members. This paper proposes that the sociology of governance approach is highly relevant for a study of telecentre sustainability. This theoretical approach is used as a lens through which to investigate issues regarding the sustainability of the Akshaya telecentre project in Kerala in terms of interactions between various groups of players. We adopt a practical reflexive-interpretive methodological approach to encourage the development and reshaping of theoretical ideas about governance through our empirical data. We identify five critical issues currently affecting sustainability of the Akshaya project focusing on how relations and exchanges have been managed over time. Our analysis has important theoretical and policy implications for the Akshaya project and more generally for telecentre initiatives launched as part of governance reform in developing countries.
