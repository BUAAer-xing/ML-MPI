This paper proposes extending the frontiers of information systems ( IS) research by seeing computer art as a kind of information system. It explores some research questions that arise if we take such a view. A new agenda for IS research is developed, based upon six themes in computer art and related work in previous IS research. The link between IS and computer art is bi-directional: our theories of information systems could inform the study of computer art, and computer art could inform our information systems theories, possibly leading to modification or even abandonment of them. Twelve research questions are suggested, and potential barriers to IS researchers studying computer art are also discussed. The paper offers possibilities, not solutions, and makes an important contribution by suggesting new opportunities for innovative research in IS and by signposting some of the topics which could be addressed.
