This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for developing constructs in MIS research. It is applicable to both individual and organizational levels of analysis, depending on the nature of the concept under study. The methodology is presented as a research guide progressing through three stages: (1) domain definition, (2) instrument construction, and (3) evaluation of measurement properties. The methodology addresses six key measurement properties (content validity, factorial validity, reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, nomological validity), which are discussed in detail. An assessment of the proposed methodology indicates that its adoption in MIS research would greatly improve the rigor of construct development projects. This is evidenced by the wide range of quality publications that have used its techniques and its performance when compared to a number of prominent standards for assessing construct development research.
