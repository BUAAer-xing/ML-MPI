In the last 20 years the 1990 joke that CIO is starting to mean 'Career Is Over' has been buried under the proliferation of CIOs, but the concept behind the CIO the idea of the C-level executive - probably is over. The C-level fad is waning as the title 'chief' is debased, but more important the very sensibility of the idea of the chief is embodied and entombed in a managerial orthodoxy of 20th century industrial administration that simply cannot hold together much longer. It is time for management educators, starting with people in the information systems field, to look beyond orthodoxy to a risky but engaging new world in which the M-Form organization and all that went with it is seen as a way station en route to a new kind of human enterprise.
