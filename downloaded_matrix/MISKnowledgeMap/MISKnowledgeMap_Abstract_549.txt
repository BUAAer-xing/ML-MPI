This paper reports the findings of an in-depth case study of implementing Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (ERP) in a long-established multinational company within the telecommunication sector. The company streamlined its operations through an ambitious business process redesign initiative and introduced an ERP system. The study examines the emergence of the ERP system and the enactment of simultaneous changes to the system and to the company context, along with the intentions and actions of the individuals involved. The study seeks to understand the ERP implementation process, in particular, the link between the ERP implementation process and the underlying and often subtle influences within the context. By drawing on the case study the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of triggers and consequences of the cycles of control and drift of ERP implementation. We argue that by taking account of managers' intentions, the affordance of technology and the power and cultural context, we can provide richer insights into the ERP implementation process and the dynamics of the underlying, subtle influences within the context.
