Information system success is dependent upon the effectiveness of requirements elicitation. Requirements elicitation is subject to numerous challenges, however, including cognitive limitations of analysts. In the present study, we test prompts designed to overcome the cognitive limitations that cause analysts to gather inadequate and inaccurate requirements. The study's results indicate that providing analysts with procedural prompts to aid their requirements elicitation can result in the acquisition of additional meaningful requirements. In addition, the procedural prompts designed to mitigate cognitive challenges were significantly more effective than simple interrogatory prompts. Theoretical implications for the elicitation of requirements and practical implications for the training and practice of systems analysts are discussed.
