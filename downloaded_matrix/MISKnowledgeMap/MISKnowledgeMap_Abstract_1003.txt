Examines the effects of demographic characteristics ( gender, marital status), household attributes ( small children, largeness of home and distance of home and workplace), support factors ( supervisor, colleague and technological- bill support), and perceived advantages and disadvantages of telecommuting to individuals, organizations and society on individuals' attitudes towards telecommuting. The sample comprised 664 IT professionals working in several internet ( portal) companies in Turkey. Results suggest that women, married employees, employees who have children less than five years old, employees whose house is big enough, employees whose house is relatively farther to the workplace, and those who perceived more advantages accruing from telecommuting, to themselves, to their organization or to the society, have a more favorable attitude towards telecommuting. On the other hand, employees who perceived more disadvantages accruing from telecommuting to themselves or their organization have a less favorable attitude towards telecommuting. In addition, colleague support and technological- bill support positively influence the attitudes of employees towards telecommuting.
