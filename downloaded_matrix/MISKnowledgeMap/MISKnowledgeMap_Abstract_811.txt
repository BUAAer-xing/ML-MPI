Although knowledge management (KM) has been examined in previous research, the utilization of KM technologies is still not well understood. Hence, in this study, a model was developed to investigate the utilization of KM technologies, specifically, knowledge portals, from the task-technology fit (TTF) perspective. An empirical study was conducted in the Chinese consulting industry to test the validity of the model. The results show that knowledge tacitness, output quality, and compatibility are positively related to utilization. Utilization and compatibility are positively related to performance. TTF is more strongly related to performance than to utilization. Implications of the results are discussed.
