Alter (2013) proposes the work system theory (WST) as the transformation of previously developed information system (IS) artifacts: the work system method (WSM), the work system framework, and the work system life cycle (WSLC). This transformation of IS artifacts into theory suggests a new set of questions regarding how we conceptualize theory and how it relates to the evaluation of IS artifacts. We conclude that such a transformation can benefit the information systems field if it enables the codification of generalized propositions that can be tested in realistic settings. Indeed, we suggest that this should be the ultimate goal of the construction of methodological IS artifacts such as those underlying the work system approach.
