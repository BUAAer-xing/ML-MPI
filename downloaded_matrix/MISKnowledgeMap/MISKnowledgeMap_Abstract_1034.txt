Previous enterprise resource planning (ERP) research has identified 'top management support' as an important factor in implementation success. However, most studies are short on the detail of exactly how and why 'top management support' contributes to ERP success. Moreover, although 'improved management decision-making' is often claimed as a business benefit of ERP systems, there is little evidence in previous ERP research of it having actually occurred. This paper examines the role of managerial agency at all levels in four Australian manufacturing organizations in achieving business benefits from ERP systems during the post-implementation period. The research contributes to current understanding of the role of managerial agency in achieving business benefits from ERP systems by providing theoretically based, detailed and interesting insights from four interpretive case studies.
