This short paper is a response to the article by McGrath in this issue which argues that information systems (IS) researchers need to be more explicit about 'being critical'. I accept her point, and I use this paper to offer a sketch of my personal journey in learning about criticality, and some thoughts from where I am now on various aspects of carrying out critical IS research.
