Corporate and academic communities have focused a great deal of attention on formalized approaches for creating, capturing, and propagating knowledge. Far less attention has been paid to the informal mechanisms that individuals share and employ to help them navigate complex processes in order to 'get things done.' In this paper, we examine the creation, use, and content of informal documents for supporting users of an enterprise resource planning system in a Fortune 500 company. We contend that such notes, which are commonly used for supporting information systems-related work, are an overlooked source of knowledgeability about organizational practices. This study is a first but necessary step in analyzing the types of information that can be derived from informal notes so that organizations can more fully utilize this largely untapped resource.
