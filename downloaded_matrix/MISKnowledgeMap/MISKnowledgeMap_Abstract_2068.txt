This paper addresses deinstitutionalization from a longitudinal perspective. Drawing on the case of software exports policymaking in Costa Rica, it analyses deinstitutionalization, paying particular attention to formation of dissensus, understood as lack of unanimity on the value of an activity that is sufficient to destabilize institutional norms and activities. The role of cultural and political factors in deinstitutionalization or persistence is considered. Based on the empirical data, a framework for understanding political and cultural dynamics in deinstitutionalization is proposed.
