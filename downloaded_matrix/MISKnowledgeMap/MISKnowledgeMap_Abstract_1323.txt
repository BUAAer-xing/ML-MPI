Adaptive structuration theory (AST) has long been an accepted framework for investigating structures within technological artifacts and work environments. Information systems, organization science and communication scholars have prefaced AST context in terms of collaborative, group decision support systems. The social structures, however, can be characterized by features of rules, resources and capabilities along with a communicative spirit. Spirit is said to enable the user to better understand and interpret the meaning of a technology. Our research varies from the traditional focus of AST studies given that our context is not in single, for-profit organization with a common corporate mission or objective. Rather, we concentrate on the HIV/AIDS pandemic among Black women and the spirit communicated to this population by a principal government healthcare website. By interacting with a group of healthcare experts and practitioners during a 14-month period, we sought to understand the site's meaning and indications as its mission is to disseminate HIV/AIDS and other pertinent medical information. Further, our findings suggest that AST is a research framework that functions as a source for the notion of spirit. The (un) intended spirit inscribed on information and communication technologies (ICT) may be (ex) inclusive with regard to the population or society it intends to serve. Hence, grassroots approaches and audiences can, in fact, offer effective insight into user-centered designs focused on educational and prevention content among those most affected and infected by chronic diseases, such as HIV. .
