This study proposes and tests a model of the information technology (IT) outsourcing decision that includes antecedents of both transaction costs and production costs. Production costs show the most robust influence on governance. Skills required to execute the activities, interdependence between the activities, and firm-level characteristics - uncertainty and knowledge intensity - are the main explanatory variables of the decision. Transaction-level uncertainty is the only transaction cost variable found to influence the decision.
