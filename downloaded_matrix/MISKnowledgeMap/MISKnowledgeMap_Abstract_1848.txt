The realized strategy contents of information systems (IS) strategizing are a result of both deliberate and emergent patterns of action. In this paper, we focus on emergent patterns of action by studying the formation of strategies that build on local technology-mediated practices. This is done through case study research of the emergence of a sustainability strategy at a European automaker. Studying the practices of four organizational sub-communities, we develop a process perspective of sub-communities' activity-based production of strategy contents. The process model explains the contextual conditions that make subcommunities initiate SI strategy contents production, the activity-based process of strategy contents production, and the IS strategy outcome. The process model, which draws on Jarzabkowski's strategy-as-practice lens and Mintzberg's strategy typology, contributes to the growing IS strategizing literature that examines local practices in IS efforts of strategic importance.
