This paper describes a collaborative action research (AR) study that took place between a U. K. university and a large U. K. manufacturing organisation, Britvic Soft Drinks Ltd. The ALTAR (Achieving Learning Through Action Research) project involved a number of AR cycles involving participants at different levels of the collaborating organisation. Britvic was already in the process of adopting knowledge management (KM) software but it was recognised that they could better exploit KM technologies by undertaking the AR project described in the paper. The project involved developing academic theory into practical concepts that influenced actions in the organisation and fed back into the academic research. The ALTAR approach and findings are described in this paper and conclusions are drawn about the AR study and its implications for AR, KM and for the future study of organisational learning through AR. The conclusions of the work are of practical use to managers in a variety of organisations and will inform academic research into cognate disciplines using the AR process.
