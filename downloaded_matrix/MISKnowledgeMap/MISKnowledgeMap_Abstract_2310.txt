This study offers a new perspective on the task-technology fit (TTF) paradigm. In contrast to prior research, we conceptualize and empirically validate TTF based on nonlinear and atomistic approaches. More specifically, we investigate how the quantitative fit between individual employees' need for a number of technological functions in a range of applications (e. g., communication, documentation, and administrative applications) and the supply of such resources affects perceived IS use and task performance. Furthermore, we contrast the various types of fit based on their location on the equilibrium points, and examine how different degrees of fit affect perceived IS use and task performance. A three-dimensional model is used to enhance our understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of the effects of TTF on performance. Our key findings suggest that TTF achievement brings IS use and IT-enabled task performance to their optimum levels. In addition, TTF at the high end of the equilibrium point is superior to that of the low end for the purposes of performance. Based on these results and the refined conceptual and methodological framework used, we identify and discuss the implications of our findings for management of IT-related resources.
