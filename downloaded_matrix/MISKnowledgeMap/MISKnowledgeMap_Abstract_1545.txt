Dysfunctional MIS is an important topic but one that has received comparatively little attention in the literature. This discussion paper attaches new literature to the subject. The new literature centres upon the epistemological status of certain forms of MIS. More specifically, it is argued that MIS, based upon metonymy (part for whole substitution), can seriously mislead managers because the representation gets mistaken for the reality. The demonstration is based on high level risk registers. Risk registers were selected for analysis because they are ubiquitous and important decision support systems. In theory, diligent use of risk registers should virtually eliminate unpleasant surprises. In practice, the result may be an illusion of control. Analysis draws upon sociology and psychology to explain why this may be so.
