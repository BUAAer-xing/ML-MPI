In this paper, we study factors that may influence college undergraduates' decisions to pursue a major in information technology (IT). We develop and test a theoretical model based on social cognitive career theory and the theory of planned behavior. Data were collected through a multi-section survey given to college undergraduates at four large universities in the southeastern United States. We found that college undergraduates with positive attitudes towards IT careers and high perceived behavioral control (PBC) regarding IT majors had a greater intention of pursuing IT majors. The study also found positive links between self-evaluating outcome expectations (SEOE) and attitudes towards an IT career. In addition, males were more likely to choose IT than females, as they scored higher on computer self-efficacy, SEOE, attitudes towards IT careers, and PBC. Future research may wish to explore this disparity and may also explore factors influencing outcome expectations and attitudes. Practical recommendations include educational and media outreach efforts aimed at emphasizing the vitality of the IT job market and the interpersonal aspects of IT. .
