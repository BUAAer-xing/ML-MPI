Throughout the world, sensitive personal information is now protected by regulatory requirements that have translated into significant new compliance oversight responsibilities for IT managers who have a legal mandate to ensure that individual employees are adequately prepared and motivated to observe policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance. This research project investigates the antecedents of information privacy policy compliance efficacy by individuals. Using Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance within the healthcare industry as a practical proxy for general organizational privacy policy compliance, the results of this survey of 234 healthcare professionals indicate that certain social conditions within the organizational setting (referred to as external cues and comprising situational support, verbal persuasion, and vicarious experience) contribute to an informal learning process. This process is distinct from the formal compliance training procedures and is shown to influence employee perceptions of efficacy to engage in compliance activities, which contributes to behavioural intention to comply with information privacy policies. Implications for managers and researchers are discussed. .
