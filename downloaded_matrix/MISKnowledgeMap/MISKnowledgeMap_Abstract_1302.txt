Research on trust has taken center stage in the MIS field in the past few decades, covering a wide range of trust-related topics based on a multitude of theories from sociology and psychology to economics. To extend this rapidly emerging trend and identify some ground-breaking perspectives on the study of trust, this special issue of the MIS Quarterly on "Novel Perspectives on Trust in Information Systems" aims to explore novel aspects of trust in new and under-researched IS contexts. In brief, the intent of the special issue was to publish innovative research articles about (1) novel ante- cedents of trust, (2) the construct of distrust and its relationship to trust, (3) the boundaries of trust, and (4) the study of trust in new and unexplored MIS contexts (Benbasat et al. 2008).
