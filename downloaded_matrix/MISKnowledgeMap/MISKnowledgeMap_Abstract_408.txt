Against the background of the first RFID-Rollouts by large retailers in North America and Europe, this paper concerns itself with the perception of RFID technology as a risk to privacy. The objective of our contribution is to identify, at a relatively early phase of the risk development, stratecric options with which RFID suppliers and users can positively influence the public acceptance of the technology. We propose a strategic framework based on research findings on risk perception and technology acceptance as well as a set of options for coping with the public perception of RFID-related privacy risks.
