We respond to Ron Weber's commentaries regarding the necessity of a theoretical core in achieving academic legitimacy for the IS field. We examine the practical problems in identifying a theoretical core, clarify the ontological connection between identity and legitimacy, acknowledge mistakes in our earlier formulation criticizing the necessity of theory in legitimation, and attempt a synthesis between our views and those of Weber. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving the workability of efforts to improve the legitimacy of the IS field.
