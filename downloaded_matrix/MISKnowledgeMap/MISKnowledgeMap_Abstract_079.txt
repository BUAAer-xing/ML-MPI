We adopt a systems perspective to explore the challenges that organizations face in harnessing knowledge. Such a perspective draws attention to mutually causal processes that have the potential to generate both vicious and virtuous circles. Based on a longitudinal study at Infosys Technologies, we conclude that knowledge management involves more than just the sponsorship of initiatives at and across different organizational levels. It also involves an active process of steering around and out of vicious circles that will inevitably emerge.
