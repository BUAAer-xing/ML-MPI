Two important views in the development of information systems are the action view and the reaction view which govern the areas of business process modelling and information systems modelling, respectively. We suggest an approach to mediate between these partially conflicting views by specifying a language-mapping framework. In other words, we specify a transition from a process model with human actors to an IS model with inanimate agents.
