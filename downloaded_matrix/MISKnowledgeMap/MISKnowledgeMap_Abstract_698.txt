Online learning applications are typically introduced with expectations that they will be used to improve learning and work practices, yet they often fall short of expectations following implementation. Numerous empirical studies have reported unintended use (and nonuse) of new IT applications, providing initial support for practice-based research for viewing emergent changes in work practices. Human agency is a core concept in theories of practice, which seek to explain how recurring patterns of action develop in social contexts such as work settings. However, current applications of theories of practice do not provide satisfactory explanations for the reasons underlying changes in work practice. In this study, we investigate changes in learning and work practices associated with the implementation of an online learning system in a Taiwanese hospital. We apply a temporal theory of human agency that disaggregates agency into elements reflecting actors' orientations to the past, present, and future. We use this theory to address the following research question: why do learning and work practices change following the implementation of online learning? The case study reveals that actors face pressures to respond to the attractions of new ways of learning while preserving traditional work practices. In addition, technological features and social structures constrain the exercise of human agency. As a result, use of the online learning system declined in the period following implementation. Our analysis adds explanatory power to the practice perspective by incorporating human agency, technological constraints, and structural conditions that affect practice.
