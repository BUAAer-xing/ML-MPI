Mobile technologies are enabling access to information in diverse environments, and are exposing a wider group of individuals to said technology. Therefore, this paper proposes that a wider view of user relations than is usually considered in information systems research is required. Specifically, we examine the potential effects of emerging mobile technologies on end-user relations with a focus on the 'secondary user', those who are not intended to interact directly with the technology but are intended consumers of the technology's output. For illustration, we draw on a study of a U. K. regional Fire and Rescue Service and deconstruct mobile technology use at Fire Service incidents. Our findings provide insights, which suggest that, because of the nature of mobile technologies and their context of use, secondary user relations in such emerging mobile environments are important and need further exploration.
