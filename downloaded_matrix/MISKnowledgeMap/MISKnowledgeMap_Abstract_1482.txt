In 1999, the automotive industry was in a difficult situation: overcapacity and customer demand for faster delivery and better service drove executives to explore the potential business value of the internet. The authors provide a teaching case, which is based on an analysis of the DCXNET initiative which bundled all e-business actions taken by DaimlerChrysler to exploit the opportunities of this then new technology. The teaching case describes the strategic planning process for e-business at DaimlerChrysler, resulting organizational structures and an outline of the components of DCXNET. Furthermore, the authors provide results of the initiative, success factors and lessons learned.
