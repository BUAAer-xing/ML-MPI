This paper suggests ways to facilitate creativity and innovation in software development. The paper applies four perspectives - Product, Project, Process, and People - to identify an outlook for software innovation. The paper then describes a new facility - Software Innovation Research Lab (SIRL) - and a new method concept for software innovation - Essence - based on views, modes, and team roles. Finally, the paper reports from an early experiment using SIRL and Essence and identifies further research.
