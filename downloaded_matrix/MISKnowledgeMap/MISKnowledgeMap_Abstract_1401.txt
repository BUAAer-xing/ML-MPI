The aim of this paper is to discuss the significance and potential of a mixed methods approach in technology acceptance research. After critically reviewing the dominance of the quantitative survey method in TAM-based research, this paper reports a mixed methods study of user acceptance of emergency alert technology in order to illustrate the benefits of combining qualitative and quantitative techniques in a single study. The main conclusion is that a mixed methods approach provides opportunities to move beyond the vague conceptualizations of "usefulness" and "ease of use" and to advance our understanding of user acceptance of technology in context.
