This paper proposes the concept of Orchestrating Smart Business Networks (SBN) as a managerial function that shapes structural dynamics for innovation. On the basis of commitment, as one way to exert power, and dynamic capacities, the suggested managerial function can develop a path of efficiency towards innovation by managing the SBN's structural dynamics, the network boundaries and digital platforms. The network's centripetal and centrifugal forces are used as the units of analysis, and this managerial function is then tested with empirical results obtained from a case study. .
