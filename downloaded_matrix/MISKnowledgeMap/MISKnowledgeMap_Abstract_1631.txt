We propose a method combining narrative analysis with grounded theory analysis to bridge the gap between breadth and depth in IS narrative research. The purpose of the method is not to develop a theory, but to make narrative analysis more accessible, transparent, and accountable, and to make the resultant narrative more contextually grounded. The method is aimed particularly at inexperienced narrative researchers who have not been guided through the complexity of narrative analysis, but it may also benefit experienced narrative researchers who may not be familiar with the applicability of grounded theory tools and techniques in this area.
