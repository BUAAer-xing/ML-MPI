Journal the Association for Information Systems ideas support systems Minnesota by DeSanctis and colleagues. One of the lesser known concepts is an analysis of the theoretical basis for group support system research. This analysis groups five theories that support GSS research into two camps: individualistic and collective. Individualistic theories are seen as prevalent in GSS research. From the individualistic perspective, technology is an active tool that works to enhance individual power. Our recent work has focused on deception and its detection, including deception stemming from individual agendas among group members in a GSS setting. This work demonstrates how group members can take advantage of the individually-focused emphasis in GSS design to successfully advance their own agendas. The purpose of this paper is to further examine the individualistic theoretical underpinnings of GSS research. To do so, we examine deception and explore its implications for groups and for GSS.
