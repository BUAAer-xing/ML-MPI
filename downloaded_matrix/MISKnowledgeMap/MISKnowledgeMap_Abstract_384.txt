This exploratory study analyzes the relationship between organizational culture and the deployment of systems development methodologies. Organizational culture is interpreted in terms of the competing values model and deployment as perceptions of the support, use, and impact of systems development methodologies. The results show that the deployment of methodologies by IS developers is primarily associated with a hierarchical culture that is oriented toward security, order, and routinization. IT managers' critical attitudes of the deployment of methodologies in organizations with a strong rational culture (focusing on productivity, efficiency, and goal achievement) is also worth noting. Based on its empirical findings, the paper proposes a theoretical model to explain the impact of organizational culture on the deployment of systems development methodologies.
