This review applauds the initiative to bring together Information Systems Strategy and Strategy-as-Practice research, as in this Special Issue. It highlights especially promising features of each of the empirical articles and develops an agenda for taking some of the themes further. In particular, the review points to opportunities for the intimate comparative investigation of episodes of Information Systems strategizing, for example by video-ethnography; focus on the under-examined impacts of new or taken-for-granted Information Systems in strategy, for example big data, social media and Excel; and consideration of the political and discursive competence of Information Systems strategists in action, by comparison with other specialists. This agenda would be effectively advanced by joint work on the part of Information Systems and Strategy-as-Practice researchers.
