Much of our prior knowledge of information systems (IS) usage is based on utilitarian systems such as personal productivity software and organizational applications. However, new generations of systems, such as online video games (OVGs), have since emerged that aim at enhancing users' hedonic outcomes like entertainment rather than utilitarian outcomes such as productivity. Prior models of utilitarian system usage provide a limited understanding of one's usage of hedonic systems, given the motivational differences between using these two types of systems. Theoretical modifications instead are required to extend the current models to hedonic systems. Expanding the research on attitude theories, we propose an initial model for usage of interactive hedonic systems, replacing perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use with perceived enjoyment and social image as the core cognitive drivers of usage, and further linking these beliefs to different technological attributes. The initial model is empirically validated using a survey of OVG usage among 485 student subjects. For IS usage research, this paper proposes and validates one of the earliest usage models of hedonic systems. For practitioners, this study provides some guidelines for manufacturers of hedonic systems on how to derive the most return on their system development efforts.
