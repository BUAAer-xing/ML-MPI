The Method for Method Configuration (MMC) has been proposed as a method engineering approach to tailoring information systems development methods. This meta-method has been used on a variety of methods, but none of these studies have focused on the ability to manage method tailoring with the intention to promote specific values and goals, such as agile ones. This paper explores how MMC has been used during three software development projects to manage method tailoring with the intention to promote agile goals and values. Through content examples of method configurations we have shown that it is possible to use MMC and its conceptual framework on eXtreme Programming and we report on lessons learned with regard to maintaining coherency with the overall goals of the original method. .
