In the past decade, business process outsourcing (BPO) has emerged as an important economic and business issue. Successful offshoring and outsourcing of business processes to low-cost destinations has made BPO a strategic decision. Inconsistencies at the client and service provider levels globally are requiring clients to build competencies in outsourcing management. Clients are further pushing service providers to build capabilities such as business process management and information technology management competencies. A research survey is carried out with European clients to identify the critical competencies of the service provider and clients for building a successful relationship. The survey indicates that the clients' focus is on BPO outcome delivery for building successful relationship and not so much on the service provider's competencies. .
