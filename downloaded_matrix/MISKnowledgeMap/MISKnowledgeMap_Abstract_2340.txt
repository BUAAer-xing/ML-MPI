Drawing data from the Mediterranean Conference on Information Systems (MCIS), we build a profile of Mediterranean information systems (IS) research and compare the emerging research landscape with recent reviews in European and international contexts. We report on research topics addressed, research methodologies employed, local empirical contexts and the composition of the related community of authors. On the basis of this data, we problematize on the meaningfulness and nature of a regional profile for IS research. Together with the six papers selected for this special issue, we aspire to contribute to the broader discourse on the diversity of IS research orientation, methodologies and agendas across different parts of the world. .
