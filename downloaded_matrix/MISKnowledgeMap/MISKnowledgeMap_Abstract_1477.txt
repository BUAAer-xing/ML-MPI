Information systems analysis and design (ISAD) arguably lies in the core of the Information Systems ( IS) discipline. Although ISAD is central to the IS curriculum, it remains somewhat at the periphery of research in leading journals. A recent study (Vessey, Ramesh, and Glass 2002) showed that few of the articles published in five leading IS research journals from 1995 to 1999 deal with these topics. This special issue is the outcome of a special joint initiative between the Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) and the Communications of the Association for Information Systems (CAIS), with the purpose of beginning to fill this void and to attract the attention of researchers to this important area. The papers in this issue illustrate a range of ISAD topics - conceptual modeling, database design, and the role of knowledge management in systems development project performance.
