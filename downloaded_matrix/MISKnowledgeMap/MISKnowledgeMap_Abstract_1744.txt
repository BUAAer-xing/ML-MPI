In telecare adoption, the lack of a strategic vision and of consistency in design choices have been identified as critical problems. Existing IS alignment literature only offers limited answers to these problems and does not acknowledge the different value configurations that telecare technology can enable. This paper, therefore, integrates work on strategic value configurations with the strategic IS alignment model in order to widen the latter's applicability. Based on the value configurations and related service management literature, a framework involving three distinct alignment configurations is developed for telecare. An analysis of two Dutch telecare projects shows how the proposed alignment profiles can explain the contrasting project outcomes more effectively than the traditional strategic alignment model would have done. The discussion reflects on the generalizability and contribution of an extended strategic alignment model.
