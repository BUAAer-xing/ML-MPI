In this article we examine the role of information technology in the relationship between ideas and managers. In particular, we explore the capacity of ideas to take hold of managers and organizations, facilitated by information technology, and contest the dominant view that ideas are passive instruments for choice. Rather, we claim that ideas tend to own us. We invert the position of the human actor and the idea, and give ideas the character of an enactor, a prerequisite for an entity that may "imprison humans". Strategies for detachment are then needed such as the old institution of jestering.
