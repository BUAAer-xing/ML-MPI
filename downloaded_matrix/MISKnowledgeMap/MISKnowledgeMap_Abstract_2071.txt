This paper describes an investigation into the utility of an agile development approach known as rapid application development (RAD) within a large-scale development project conducted within the public sector in the UK. Features of RAD as an 'agile' information systems development method (ISDM) are discussed and previous research identifying properties of development environments most conducive to its application are described. A case study is then presented based upon a long-term qualitative investigation of the 'unbundling' of a commercial RAD-like ISDM. The evidence from this case leads us to question established wisdom in relation to appropriate adoption and application of agile development within large-scale and complex development environments.
