This paper re-conceptualizes "information system success" as a formative, multidimensional index. Such a validated and widely accepted index would facilitate cumulative research on the impacts of IS, while at the same time provide a benchmark for organizations to track their IS performance. The proposed IS-Impact measurement model represents the stream of net benefits from an Information System (IS), to date and anticipated, as perceived by all key user groups. Model measures are formulated to be robust, economical, and simple, yielding results that are comparable across diverse systems and contexts, and from multiple user perspectives. The model includes four dimensions in two halves. The "impact" half measures benefits to date, or Individual- and Organizational Impact; the "quality" half uses System Quality and Information Quality as proxies for probable future impacts. Study findings evidence the necessity, additivity, and completeness of these four dimensions.
