Previous studies in information systems research and service marketing treat customer behaviour towards technology-based services (TBS) homogeneously. However, recent studies recognize that users have different attitude towards different technologies even if these technologies used to support the same service. Drawing on literature from service marketing (i.e. customer contact theory), information systems ( unified theory of technology acceptance), and organizational behaviour ( task complexity theory), this study proposes a construct that classifies TBS according to the level of customer-technology interaction they require, namely the customer-technology contact (CTC). The moderating effect of this construct on the relationship between individual characteristics-that is technology readiness and attitude towards TBS - is examined through an empirical study. Technology-based retail services scenarios, with different levels of technology contact, are presented to supermarket shoppers (n=600). Results show that CTC, as a unique service attribute, moderates the effect of personality traits to customers' attitude. The current study introduces this new service attribute that is applicable to ubiquitous computing services, application and design.
