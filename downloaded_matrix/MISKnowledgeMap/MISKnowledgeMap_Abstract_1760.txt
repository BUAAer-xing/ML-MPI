A theoretical model of professional identification is developed and empirically examined as a means to understanding information technology (IT) workers' attachment to the IT profession. Professional identification represents oneness with or belonging to a profession and provides a unique means of investigating and evaluating the IT profession. Results from a survey of 305 IT workers indicate that professional identification is directly impacted by three factors: (1) the individual's need for professional identification; (2) the individual's perceived similarity to others in the IT profession; and (3) the individual's perceptions of the IT profession, signifying the importance of internalization to identification. Professional identification is also indirectly impacted by the public's perception of the IT profession. .
