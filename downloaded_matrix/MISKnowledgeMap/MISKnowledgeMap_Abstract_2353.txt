This study develops a comprehensive model to predict and explain the use of collaborative technologies (CT) and the task performance of individual users as a result of using CT. The integrated model attempts to capture how the individual user's extent of use of CT is a function of both the technical features and the structures embedded within or created by the interactions among the technology, group, and organization. The model developed is tested using data collected from a national bank with 279 members working in 40 different workgroups. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) is used to test the hypotheses generated from the model. Results show that our integrated model provides a more complete explanation of the use of CT and task performance beyond those of the individual-level factors. The study is an early effort to develop an integrated theory to provide comprehensive insight into individual use of CT in a group or organizational context.
