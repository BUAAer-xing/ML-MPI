This study explores the factors that can impact individual performance when using enterprise resource planning ( ERP) systems. Starting from the proposition that organizational performance depends on individuals' task accomplishments, we test a structural model of task-technology fit, ERP user satisfaction, and individual performance in ERP environments. This research utilizes a survey method to examine the perceptions of ERP users. We performed factor and reliability analyses to assess the validity of the survey instrument. Six factors were identified as having an impact on individual performance: System Quality, Documentation, Ease of use, Reliability, Authorization, and Utilization. To explore the relationships among these factors, we conducted regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines analysis, and compared the findings from these two analytical techniques. The study provides evidence that System Quality, Utilization, and Ease of Use are the most important factors bearing on individual performance in ERP environments. Our findings also provide IT managers and researchers with knowledge of how these factors can be manipulated to improve individual performance when using ERP systems.
