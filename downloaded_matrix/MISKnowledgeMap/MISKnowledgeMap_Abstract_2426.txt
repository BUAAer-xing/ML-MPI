We introduce a new type of article, "Issues and Opinions," in this issue. The first article presents an analysis of the publishing opportunities for information systems research in the premier outlets and compares it with the opportunities in other business disciplines. An expansion of the editorial board is announced with the names of 14 new associate editors. Finally, the synergy between the journal and the Information Systems Society is once again reiterated.
