Agile development methodologies such as Extreme Programming are becoming increasingly popular due to their focus on managing time to market constraints and the ability to accommodate changes during the software development life cycle. However, such methodologies need to be adapted to suit the needs of different contexts. Past literature has paid little attention to examine the adaptation of agile methodologies. Using adaptive structuration theory as a lens to analyze data from a multisite case study, we examine how the structure of agile methods, projects, and organizations affect the adaptation of agile methodologies. We describe the various sources of structure that affect appropriation of agile practices, the set of appropriated practices and their characteristics, and their link to process outcomes. Based on our findings, we provide prescriptions for adapting agile development methodologies. We also discuss how adapted agile practices can address several challenges faced by agile development teams. .
