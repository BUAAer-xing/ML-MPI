This paper presents quantitative and qualitative results from a conference on IT teaching held in May of 2006 in Boston. Participants completed a survey in advance, and the conference consisted of presentations and interactive panel discussions. The conference revealed both heterogeneity and convergence across participants' course offerings, and grounds for both optimism and concern about the health and future of IT curricula within business schools. This paper highlights these tensions, synthesizes and extends data and discussions from the conference, and suggests open questions for faculty who teach IT.
