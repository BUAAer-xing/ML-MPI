Research in both the organizational and information systems areas suggests that aligning information systems and dimensions of the organization improves performance. However, the dynamic nature of both information systems and organizations makes a close alignment more an aspiration than a state. This paper examines alignment from the perspective of the management processes through which companies may achieve and sustain alignment in dynamic environments. In so doing they may also develop core capabilities in managing IS innovation, which enable sustained competitive advantage. The paper traces the evolution of alignment in a company that used information systems to develop the business in new strategic directions, and shows how semi-structures contributed to this.
