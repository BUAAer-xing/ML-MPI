The research in this paper explores how the general context and management information and communication behaviour in electronic Reverse Auctions ( e-RAs) may impact on organizational efficiency to ensure procurement excellence. There is evidence that e-RAs improve procurement success by achieving considerable price reductions of externally sourced goods through direct, real-time and transparent competition between suppliers. This paper investigates the conditions for the successful adoption of e-RAs in the U. K. public sector generally and Welsh Unitary Authorities ( WUAs) in particular. The research illustrates how e-RAs can support the procurement function and thus, can contribute to organizational efficiency in the context of electronic government ( e-Government). A national U. K. survey and an exploratory case analysis in a WUA ( Conwy) were undertaken to determine the conditions for the e-RA process. The findings underline the critical importance of the adequate preparation of the e-RA through appropriate information and communication behaviour. Consequently, the paper identifies a set of enabling factors and corresponding guidelines that could be used for the successful adoption of e-RAs in the public sector. The contribution of the research will be of benefit to both academics and practitioners engaged in procurement research and implementation.
