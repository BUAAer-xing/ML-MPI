Business process modelling has gained widespread acceptance as a valuable design and management technique for a variety of purposes. While there has been much research on process modelling techniques and corresponding tools, there has been little empirical research into the success factors of effective process modelling, and the post hoc evaluation of process modelling success. This paper reports on the first attempt to identify process modelling success factors and measures, as empirically evidenced in case studies of nine process modelling projects in three leading Australian organizations.
