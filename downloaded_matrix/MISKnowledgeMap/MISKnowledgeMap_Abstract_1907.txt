We contend that in order to compete effectively in a digital business environment, firms should develop a transparency strategy by selectively disclosing information outside the boundaries of the firm. We make the case for transparency strategy by showing why it is relevant in the digital business world, and the consequences of not having such a strategy. We then provide some foundations to develop the strategy and make a call for research.
